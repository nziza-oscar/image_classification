# Image Classification in a Node.js Application

## Problem Statement

### **Title:**
**Developing an Image Classification Web Application Using TensorFlow.js and EJS**

### **Problem**
With the increasing need for automated image recognition, many applications require an efficient way to classify and identify objects in images. Traditional approaches often rely on complex backend processing, making them less accessible for real-time web applications. There is a need for a simple, lightweight, and easy-to-use web-based image classification system that can provide real-time predictions without requiring extensive machine learning expertise.

### **Objective**
The goal of this project is to develop a web-based image classification application using **Node.js**, **TensorFlow.js**, and **EJS**. The application will allow users to upload images, process them using a pre-trained deep learning model (**MobileNet**), and display classification results with confidence scores.

### **Scope & Features**
- A user-friendly web interface for uploading images.
- Backend processing using **Node.js** and **TensorFlow.js** for classification.
- Use of the **MobileNet model** for efficient and accurate image recognition.
- Display of top predictions with confidence scores.
- Support for multiple image formats.
- Real-time processing for quick responses.

This project will help developers and businesses integrate AI-powered image classification into their applications for various use cases like object detection, content moderation, and automated labeling. ðŸš€
